# tiny-renderer roadmap

This roadmap tracks executable architectural capabilities rather than release marketing. A milestone is considered complete only after its implementation and regression coverage are integrated and the exact `main` commit passes the repository's Linux, macOS, and ASan/UBSan CI gates.

## Completed capability chain

Milestones 1–16 established the CPU raster pipeline, indexed meshes, generalized varyings, deterministic fixed-point coverage, interpolation qualifiers, in-memory textures, bounded OBJ/PPM import, inverse-transpose normals plus directional Lambert lighting, OBJ normals, runtime material albedo, bounded MTL import, explicit base-color source selection, owned `map_Kd` textures, canonical `ModelAsset` draw ranges, and direct range execution.

### Milestone 17 — single-pass canonical OBJ model parsing

- Rich OBJ geometry and material metadata are produced by one canonical parse result rather than two cross-checked source scans.
- Legacy geometry-only `load_obj` behavior remains source-compatible and continues to ignore material metadata syntax.
- Ordered face-material association, deterministic source-line diagnostics, Kd-only rendering, and mapped-texture rendering remain regression-covered.

### Milestone 18 — first-class `ModelAsset` submission

- Runtime `ModelAsset` / `MaterialDraw` types are independent of the OBJ loader.
- `draw_model_asset` owns the orchestration for material/texture/base-color state while every accepted draw still executes through `draw_mesh_range`.
- Complete model/draw state is preflighted before any framebuffer write, preventing a malformed later draw from partially committing earlier draws.

### Milestone 19 — prepared model submission plans

- `PreparedModelSubmission` owns a validated snapshot of canonical topology, draw records, render options, and shared texture lifetime.
- Static preparation is framebuffer-independent; dynamic framebuffer/transform/light validation remains fail-closed at execution.
- Prepared execution is reusable and byte/hash-equivalent to direct model submission.

### Milestone 20 — shared range/model raster preflight

- Range and model dynamic submission validation share one internal preflight implementation.
- `rasterizer_range.cpp` is orchestration-only rather than maintaining a mirror validator.
- Model preflight no longer depends on submitting an empty draw range as a validation side effect.
- Selected-index semantics and the established all-vertex varying/UV/normal validation contract remain regression-locked.

### Milestone 21 — prepared model instance batches

- `draw_prepared_model_instances` accepts caller-owned spans of model transforms or precomposed MVP transforms without introducing a scene graph or duplicating mesh/material/texture storage.
- A non-empty batch preflights every instance × material-draw dynamic state before the first framebuffer mutation.
- Execution order is deterministic: instance input order, then canonical material-draw order within each instance.
- Batch rendering is byte/hash-equivalent to the same prepared instances submitted sequentially.
- Equal-depth lit instances make input order observably deterministic under the renderer's strict `<` depth rule.
- A singular later lighting transform rejects the entire batch before earlier valid instances can write; empty batches are deterministic no-ops.
- MVP-only batches preserve the existing rule that directional lighting requires separate model/view/projection transforms.

## Next frontier — Milestone 22

The next architectural promotion should be a **bounded heterogeneous prepared submission list**: one ordered batch containing references to multiple prepared model plans plus per-entry transforms, with whole-list fail-closed preflight before execution. The goal is to compose different meshes/material sets without introducing a general scene graph or command-buffer subsystem prematurely.

Acceptance for that slice should require:

- heterogeneous prepared models execute in exact caller order and remain byte/hash-equivalent to the same sequential calls;
- every entry is preflighted before the first framebuffer write, including later-entry singular lighting transforms and incompatible framebuffer/draw state;
- prepared asset and texture ownership remains with the prepared plans rather than copied into per-frame commands;
- empty submission lists are deterministic no-ops;
- no new rasterization path is introduced: accepted entries still reach the existing shared preflight, `draw_mesh_range`, and triangle core;
- no performance claim is made without a controlled benchmark.

## Deliberate later work

General/full OBJ and MTL syntax, polygon triangulation, relative OBJ indices, smoothing/generated normals, multiple material libraries, general image formats, mipmaps, anisotropic filtering, sRGB handling, anti-aliasing, back-face culling, configurable depth functions/reversed-Z, specular/PBR lighting, shadows, normal maps, programmable shaders, GPU acceleration, and a general scene graph remain outside the current bounded CPU teaching architecture until a higher-value integration milestone justifies them.
